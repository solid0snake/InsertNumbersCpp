# Insert Numbers Cpp
Given a file that contains a formatted list of integers (1 through 24 and 71 through 99), where each integer occupies one single line and takes 4 characters' space per line, this C++ program inserts the numbers 25 through 70 into this file while maintaining the original format (i.e., each integer occupies a single line and takes 4 characters' space).
